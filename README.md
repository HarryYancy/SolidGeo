## Dataset Description

**SolidGeo** is the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks in **solid geometry**. **SolidGeo** consists of **3,113** real-world Kâ€“12 and competition-level problems, each paired with visual context and annotated with **3** difficulty levels and **8** fine-grained solid geometry categories. Our benchmark covers a wide range of 3D reasoning subjects such as projection, unfolding, spatial measurement, and spatial vector, offering a rigorous testbed for assessing solid geometry.Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in solid geometry math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on **SolidGeo** .We hope **SolidGeo** serves as a catalyst for advancing MLLMs toward deeper geometric reasoning and spatial intelligence.
