It is partially filled with water, reaching a height of 5 units. If the container is tilted (without spilling any water), the main view of the tilted rectangular container is shown in Figure (2).

    "model_answer": "To determine the length of \\( CD \\) in the tilted rectangular container, we need to analyze the geometry of the situation. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Dimensions and Initial Setup:**\n   - The container has a length and width of 2 units each and a height of 8 units.\n   - The container is partially filled with water to a height of 5 units.\n\n2. **Tilt the Container:**\n   - When the container is tilted, the water level remains the same, but the container's orientation changes.\n   - The main view of the tilted container shows a parallelogram \\( ABCD \\) where \\( AB \\) and \\( CD \\) are the lengths of the container, and \\( AD \\) and \\( BC \\) are the heights.\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Dimensions:**\n   - The length of the container \\( AB \\) is 2 units.\n   - The height of the water level in the tilted container is still 5 units.\n\n4. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   - In the tilted position, the length \\( CD \\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height of the water and the length of the container.\n   - The height of the water (5 units) and the length of the container (2 units) form the legs of the right triangle, and \\( CD \\) is the hypotenuse.\n\n5. **Calculate \\( CD \\):**\n   \\[\n   CD = \\sqrt{(2)^2 + (5)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 25} = \\sqrt{29}\n   \\]\n   - However, this calculation does not match any of the given options. We need to reconsider the geometry.\n   - The correct approach is to recognize that the tilt creates a right triangle where the hypotenuse is the diagonal of the rectangle formed by the length and the height of the water.\n   - The correct dimensions to use are the length of the container (2 units) and the height of the water (5 units), but the actual diagonal of the rectangle formed by these dimensions is:\n   \\[\n   CD = \\sqrt{(2)^2 + (8)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 64} = \\sqrt{68} = 2\\sqrt{17}\n   \\]\n   - This still does not match the options. The correct interpretation is that the tilt creates a right triangle with the height of the water (5 units) and the full height of the container (8 units).\n   \\[\n   CD = \\sqrt{(2)^2 + (8)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 64} = \\sqrt{68} = 2\\sqrt{17}\n   \\]\n   -

    "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the values of 'a' and 'b' such that the sum of the numbers on any two opposite faces of the cube is equal. Let's analyze the given net of the cube step by step.\n\n1. Identify the pairs of opposite faces:\n   - The face with number 6 is opposite to the face with number 'b'.\n   - The face with number 4 is opposite to the face with number 5.\n   - The face with number 8 is opposite to the face with number 'a'.\n\n2.
